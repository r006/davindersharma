          <p class="bold">A.	&#160; Designed transmitter of V.23 FSK modem for secure communication systems and implemented it on
TMS320C50 DSP chip (UGC Project)

          </p><br>



          <p> Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) based V.23 modem for secure data transmission over Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) was implemented during this study. Although modulation schemes with high bit rates are available, still FSK with low bit rate is more useful where security is of major concern. Moreover, FSK modems are well suited for underwater secure data transmission in submarines. Therefore, keeping security features in mind, this work based on soft implementation of V.23 standard based FSK modem on Digital Signal Processor (DSP) chip was carried out. Algorithms for different functional units of FSK modem like Sine Wave Generator, FSK Modulator, Emission Filter, FSK Demodulator containing Delay Line Filter and Low Pass Filter were developed and implementation on DSP. Functioning of implemented units was found satisfactory. This work was in the direction of supporting new emerging embedded modem technology and will aid the embedded modem manufacturers in developing efficient, fast, flexible, small and cheaper DSP based V.23 embedded modem for secure communication.

          <p><b>Summary -</b> This research work was based on the development of V.90 standard based 56kbps modem (fastest possible modem on general telephone line) using digital signal processor. During the present study efficient algorithms, to implement various functional units of digital modem transmitter on Texas Instruments based TMS320C50PQ57 DSP chip, were developed. Simulation and computer aided analysis was carried out along with their implementation on DSP chip. Scrambler, Bit Parser, Modulus Encoder, Data Mappers, Parse to Shaping Frame and Differential Encoder are the functional units of the transmitter that were simulated and implemented on DSP during the present study for providing embedded modem solutions to the modem manufacturer.</p><br>
