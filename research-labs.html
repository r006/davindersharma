               micro-grid of De Lorenzo, USA has been setup that can mimic electrical grid and is first in the Caribbean region to provide training in the area of Smart Grid Technology. This Micro-grid is being used to carry out research in the area of Smart Grid Technology and understanding integration challenges of renewable energy sources with our local electric grid. Laboratory is equipped with state of art test & measurement equipment, high-power computing facility, power system analysis tools and smart sensors / hardware. Smart Grid lab. is being used for research projects / lab. experiments of M.Sc. Renewable Energy Technology, Major / Minor in Electronics, MA Sc. and B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering students. </p><br><br>

          <p class="justify-text">To fulfill the increasing demand of energy as well as to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, sustainable and clean
               energy systems are
               needed. Most of the countries including Trinidad and Tobago are looking for Carbon – Neutral ways to generate energy from waste and
               Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) seems to be one of the alternative. MFCs are living, galvanic electrochemical systems in which the
               anoxic activity of microorganisms on waste matter generates electrons and cations and hence electricity.  We are doing experimental
               work on designing and optimizing MFC prototype for its applications towards clean and sustainable energy generation, wastewater
               treatment, oil spill remediation or some other bio-remediated activities. The inter – comparison of these systems based on models to
               be implemented using Matlab and COMSOL Multiphysics software packages is also being done. <br><br>
               Microbial fuel cell laboratory has been established at 3rd floor of natural science building (old wing), Department of Physics.
