               <h5>Lab Courses</h5>
               <li><b>PHYS 3163 (Electronics Laboratory)/ PHYS 3202 (Practical Electronics I)  </b></li>
               <p><b>Course description:</b>This laboratory based course consists of advance level laboratory exercises and mini project from analog & digital communication and control systems. Laboratory experiments covering topic areas of the courses ECNG 2001 –Communication System –I, ECNG 3001 - Communication Systems–II and PHYS 3201 - Advance Electronics and Control Theory will be performed. The purpose of this experimental based laboratory course is to give students hands-on experience and to allow them to test the principles which they learn from the theoretical components of the courses.<br>

The students will be expected to perform the laboratory exercises and collect their data and depending on the complexity of the exercise will submit the written report at the end of the exercise or submit it the following week for assessment.

               <p><b>Course description:</b>Students will be required to complete a 12 weeks research project for completion of their Major in Physics. Projects will be offered in the various disciplines of Physics and each Project will be assigned a Project Supervisor. Projects may involve pure research study toward a fundamental aspect of Physics or address more applied issues. It may involve field or laboratory based work or may be a desk study involving data analysis or interrogation of legal documents. The project should, however, give the student a chance to further develop skills from the toolbox and a more detailed understanding of some component of the course. This course is offered in both Semester I & II
