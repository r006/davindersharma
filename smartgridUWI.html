          <p class="bold">RDI Funded TTD 550000.00 Project on “Capacity Building and Research on Smart Grid Technology in the Caribbean Region”</p><br>
          
          <p>I lead this interdisciplinary project funded by the UWI T&T RDI Fund. Team members include Prof. Patrick Hosein (Department of Computing & Information Technology), Dr. Ajay Joshi (Sr. Lecturer, Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering), Dr. Sanjay Bahadoorsingh (Sr. Lecturer, Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering) and Mr. Miguel Andrews (Caribbean Industrial Research Institute (CARIRI)). Our Stakeholders include the Ministry of Energy & Energy Affairs (MOEEA), the Ministry of Education (MOE), T&T Electricity Commission (T&TEC), Telecommunication Authority of T&T (TATT), BG T&T, National Institute of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology (NIHERST), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) T&T and Regulated Industries Commission (RIC) T&T.</p><br>
          
          <p><b>Summary</b>: Today world’s 80.6% of energy needs are dependent on fossil fuels, which are depleting at a very faster rate, so countries all over the world are charting new ways to produce, distribute, deliver and use electricity. Most of the developed countries are now looking at enhancement to their 20th century grids and a new concept called Smart Grid (SG) is emerging. 
          Due to abundant fossil fuel resources and strong oil based economy, islands like Trinidad and Tobago has become one of the highest greenhouse gases emitting countries in the world on per capita basis. Hence there is a need of developing Smart Grid Technology within the Caribbean region to improve energy efficiency of existing power grids, to reduce the energy cost, to allow a much greater utilisation of renewables in the grid, to decrease greenhouse gases emission and to provide reliable supply of energy throughout the region. 
          By this project we aimed at evaluating the suitability of our power grid for deployment of smart grid technology, capacity building in this area through Workshops and a Training Program, public awareness through Public Lectures and electronic media, research on smart infrastructure development and establishing network of policy makers, field professional, researcher and teacher within the Caribbean region. </p><br>
