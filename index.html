                                   Abstract: World energy demand is increasing day-by-day, which has resulted in the increase in Carbon emission globally. To mitigate these challenges and adhere to their commitment towards Paris Agreement, most of
                                   the countries are trying to reduce their dependency on fossil fuel and started integrating renewable energy sources like Solar, Wind, Hydro and Fuel Cell into their energy mix. In my presentation I will be
                                   discussing a special type of Fuel Cell called Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC), which is a bio-electrochemical system that uses bacteria from waste to convert organic molecules directly into electrical energy under
                                   anaerobic conditions. Prototypes development and optimization of MFC for its electricity generation and waste water treatment capability will be discussed along with popular modelling tool.<br><br>

               <h3 id="mobile-h3">Brief Profile</h3>
               <p id="mobile-p">I have received my BSc. degree in Electronics (1997), M.Sc. degree in Applied Physics (1999) and Ph.D. degree in Applied Physics (Communication Signal Processing - 2004), all from Guru Nanak Dev
                    University, Amritsar, India. I have 25 years of teaching experience in different areas of Physics and Electronics. I have taught at Guru Nanak Dev University (1999-2002) and Amritsar College of Engineering and
                    Technology (2002-2008). I then joined Department of Physics, The University of the West Indies, Trinidad and Tobago, in 2008 as Lecturer in Electronics and currently serving as senior lecturer (associate professor). I have served as the head of Physics department for 2 terms (6 years). My
                    research interests include application of digital signal processing for communication systems, speech recognition, smart grid technology, medical devices and modeling & optimization of solar cells and microbial fuel cells. I have published 2 books, 3 book chapters, 36 peer-reviewed journal articles and 22 conference papers at national/ international level. I have attracted various research grants and organized
                    many workshops/training programmes in association with different national/international bodies.</p>

                    <p id="mobile-p">Title of Presentation: Design, Optimization and Modelling of Microbial Fuel Cell<br><br>
                         Day and Time: 17th July 2021, 9am.<br><br>
                         Abstract: World energy demand is increasing day-by-day, which has resulted in the increase in Carbon emission globally. To mitigate these challenges and adhere to their commitment towards Paris Agreement, most of
                         the countries are trying to reduce their dependency on fossil fuel and started integrating renewable energy sources like Solar, Wind, Hydro and Fuel Cell into their energy mix. In my presentation I will be
                         discussing a special type of Fuel Cell called Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC), which is a bio-electrochemical system that uses bacteria from waste to convert organic molecules directly into electrical energy under
                         anaerobic conditions. Prototypes development and optimization of MFC for its electricity generation and waste water treatment capability will be discussed along with popular modelling tool.<br><br>
