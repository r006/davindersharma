## Why I'm Proud of This Project

This project was a meaningful learning experience, and I'm proud of how it turned out. I began by designing the user interface in Adobe XD, aiming for a layout that is clean, professional, and easy to navigate. This helped me carefully plan the structure and visual hierarchy before moving into development.

After finalizing the design, I built the site using HTML and CSS. While the project doesn't include any significant backend functionality, this was a deliberate choice based on the simplicity of the client’s needs. The goal was to create a static, informative website that presents academic content clearly and professionally.
I also took care to ensure that the website is well-optimized for search engines by using semantic HTML, meaningful page titles, meta tags, and a clear content structure. These elements help improve the site’s visibility and accessibility on search platforms.

Even though the technical requirements were straightforward, the project gave me the opportunity to focus on responsive design, accessibility, and delivering a polished user experience. It’s rewarding to see the final product and know that it effectively meets the client’s goals.
